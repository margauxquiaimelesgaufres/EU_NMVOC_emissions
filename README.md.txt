# README-file: project : NMVOC emissions in EU

#### Welcome to our README file's project!

This file will provide basic information about our project to get an idea of it.

This project is a term project for the TEP4221 course: [Python for Sustainable Analysis](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TEP4221#tab=omEmnet) at NTNU.

It's made by Tobias Hafskjold Bu and Margaux Barone.

## What the project does

The purpose of the project work is to learn how to conduct our own data processing and management project using Python.

In the project, we applied the programming and data management skills we have learned thus far from DataCamp, lectures, and tutorials.

This project aims to be a template for a Python project that we can use in our future endeavours.

The subject of the project is NMVOC emissions from air pollution over time in the EU.

The deliverable of this project is a "popular science" article about NMVOCs pollutant description and also includes selected Python plots we have created.

## Why the project is useful

The project helps to : 
- discover what NMVOCs is,
- in which sector NMVOCs useful,
- How emissions have changed over time, 
- and why it's important to consider this pollutant in relation to climate change.


## How users can get started with the project

First, reading this file is a good way to get started with the project.

After that, you can go to our project presentation to have a deeper look at it. Here's the link: [Project presentation - NMVOC emissions in EU](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BLiNWpAvrJPw0kJpbctCuRoz9rSralYQzr5-atrxLlM/edit?usp=share_link)

Since it's done, you can read our article to discover our results and research.

If you want to know how we plotted the graphs, you can also check the coding file.

## Where users can get help with your project

In the event that someone wants to build on this project or use it in some other way, Margaux and Tobias can be contacted on their student email to provide any help required. 


## Who maintains and contributes to the project

Since this is a deliverable for a course and not a dedicated project, the maintainance and contributions for this project will be freezed after it is delivered for grading.
